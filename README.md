# Stock Prediction and Trading System
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive stock prediction and trading system that integrates historical stock data with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting future stock prices. The system dynamically updates the database based on user input, integrates trading logic using C++, and provides visualizations via Power BI and Streamlit.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

Data Handling: Manages stock data retrieval, preprocessing, and database interactions.
Machine Learning: Uses an LSTM model for stock price predictions.
Trading Logic: Implements trading strategies using C++ and integrates with Python code via Cython.
Visualization: Displays predictions and trading performance using Power BI and Streamlit.
## Files
main.py: Main script for running the prediction, visualization, and database operations.
testing.py: Script for testing and validating code before integration into main.py.
utils.py: Contains utility functions for data processing, model loading, and database management.
workflow.py: Handles database operations including creation, updates, and schema management.
## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
SQLite3
C++ compiler (for Cython integration)
Power BI Desktop
Streamlit

## Python Dependencies
Install required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tensorflow sqlite3 cython yfinance

## Setting Up the Database
Create or Replace Database: Use the function provided in utils.py to create or replace the database schema and populate it with stock data.
Running the Main Script
Load Data and Model: The main.py script loads stock data, preprocesses it, makes predictions using the LSTM model, and updates the database with new data.
## Integrating C++ for Trading Logic
Implement trading strategies in C++ and use Cython for integration with Python code.
## Power BI Integration
Connect Power BI to your SQLite database to visualize stock data and model predictions. Create dashboards that dynamically update based on user input.
## Streamlit Web Application
Develop a Streamlit web app to provide an interactive interface for users to input stock tickers and view predictions and trading strategies.
## Usage
Run main.py to execute the prediction and database update process.
Use testing.py to validate code before integration.
Visualize data using Power BI by connecting to the stock_data.db.
Deploy the Streamlit app to provide real-time predictions and trading insights.
